## Analytics Repository

This repository holds several ipython notebooks and the matching data for data analysis. Most of those items were assignments during my training
at General Assembly (Hong-Kong branch) and covers the following topics (among others):

* Machine Learning (linear regression, classification, trees, etc...)
* Data Mining (Beautiful Soup, Twitter API)
* Database (MongoDB)

In short those are useful Python recipes for data visualization, web scrapping and so on.

The sub-folder `Data` contains all used data sets, along with output files.

At the time, this repository holds the following notebooks:

* __AbaloneRegression__ : A work on simple linear and polynomial regression made on the famous _abalone_ dataset.
* __LinguisSearch__ : A study on how web-scrapping, targeting the website [lingbuzz](http://ling.auf.net); not perfect
but efficient.
* __LogisticRegression__ : A study on logistic regression, trying to predict delayed flights from several features.
* __MongoTweet__ : A walk-through on how to use the Twitter API to get tweets and store them in MongoDB collections (should be updated with
some work on said data, maybe sentiment analysis).
* __SkinAndTrees__ : A study on k-nearest neighbors and decision trees for classification; the dataset consists in observations of different
color components (BGR) and the target is to determine whether said color is a skin color or not.

I intend to continue to update this repository over time, adding new studies on different datasets, API or whatnot.
