## Analytics Repository

This repository holds several ipython notebooks and the matching data for data analysis. Most of those items were assignments during my training
at General Assembly (Hong-Kong branch) and covers the following topics (among others):

* Machine Learning (linear regression, classification, trees, etc...)
* Data Mining (Beautiful Soup, Twitter API)
* Database (MongoDB)

In short those are useful Python recipes for data visualization, web scrapping and so on.

The sub-folder `Data` contains all used data sets, along with output files.
